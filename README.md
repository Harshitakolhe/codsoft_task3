CODSOFT INTERNSHIP LEVEL 1 TASK 3

NAME:-HARSHITA MANISH KOLHE

DOMAIN:-WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION:-1 MONTH 

I built a simple digital calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I used a grid layout to organize the buttons and styled the interface for a modern look, while the JavaScript code handles input, calculations using the eval() function, and error management.
