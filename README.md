CODSOFT INTERNSHIP LEVEL 1 TASK 3

NAME: HARSHITA MANISH KOLHE
DOMAIN: WEB DEVELOPMENT
DURATION: 1 MONTH

I developed a simple digital calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I utilized a grid layout for button organization and styled the interface to create a modern, user-friendly design. The JavaScript functionality manages user input, performs calculations with the eval() function, and handles errors gracefully by displaying an error message when invalid input is entered.
